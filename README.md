#This is the README file for BeerMe :shipit:

###Title: BeerMe

###Vision: 
Those 21 years of age and over will have access to a straightforward application that gives an instant and personal recommendation for what type of beer(s) would best fit his/her given situation, based on his/her input.

###Who:
- Michelle Bray
- Jon Allured
- Spencer Wilson
- Jacob Levine
- Matthew Geckel

###Repo Organization:
- cgi-bin (where the .py web pages are)
- images folder
- database folder
- Assignments folder (parts 1-7 in markdown format)
- autoDocFiles folder (with Doxygen test outputs)
- html folder (backup of web pages as .html)

###How to Build/Run:
- must run our webpage on a local server
- python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000 (to run server)
- go to localhost:8000/cgi-bin/verifyage.py 
- verifyage.py (in the cgi-bin) is the initial homepage, to be run locally
- this should take you to index.py once you verify your age so that you can access full functionality of the site
