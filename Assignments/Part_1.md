##Project Part 1: Proposal Submission & Repository

###Who:
- Michelle Bray
- Spencer Wilson
- Jon Allured
- Jacob Levine
- Matthew Geckel

###Title: 
Beer Me

###Description: 
A web application that will provide users with beer recommendations based on recent activity and upcoming events.

###Vision Statement:
Those 21 years of age and over will have access to a straightforward application that gives an instant and personal recommendation for what type of beer would best fit his/her given situation, based on his/her input.

###Motivation: 
- We wanted to do something fun, to help keep us interested and motivated to work on the project
- Most target users are in our age range or above
- Helps those who are inexperienced or indecisive
- Helps fill a niche - people are often out with friends and donâ€™t know what kind of beer to order
- Help promote quality over quantity
- Personal interest in craft beer

###Risks: 
- Group members may need to  learn HTML or other web languages like GO
  - Mitigation: We will try to choose a language that at least some of the group has experience with, and any group member that needs to learn a new language will be responsible for taking the relevant tutorials and/or devoting the extra time needed to work with and figure out the new language
- Time constraints could be an issue depending on the complexity of the app
  - Mitigation: The base idea can be completed within a reasonable time period with the option to extend the project to new fields based on available time
- Could possibly encourage binge drinking
  - Mitigation: We will approach this project from a professional standpoint and make sure to include an age check screen before granting access to the actual app
